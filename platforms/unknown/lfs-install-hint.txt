=================
1. Introduction
=================

apcctrl is useful for controlling American Power Conversion's (APC)
uninterruptiple power supplies (UPS).  apcctrl monitors the UPS and during a
power loss, informs the system users of the failure, and if power is not 
restored, safely shuts down the system.  The apcctrl manual (available on line
at http://www.sibbald.com/apcctrl/manual/index.html or with the software)
provides excellent instructions on installing and configuring the software.
The configure script can identify several standard linux distributions and make
the correct installation. However, as LFS is by design not standard this hint
provides the information to protect an LFS system with an APC UPS using
apcctrl.

The installation of apcctrl is mostly straightforward until "make install" is
completed. Then the LFS user will see the following series of messages:

"Unknown distribution
You have to manually install apcctrl boot script and
halt script for clean emergency shutdown.
Please contribute your distribution install to apcctrl team.
I'm sorry: you are on your own."

The purpose of this hint is to provide one method of accomplishing the above
actions to get apcctrl up and running on the LFS "unknown" distribution.

=================
2. Software
=================

The apcctrl software can be found at these sites:

http://www.oasi.gpa.it/riccardo/linux/apcctrl/
http://www.sibbald.com/apcctrl/
ftp://ftp.oasi.gpa.it/pub/apcctrl/

As of this writing the latest stable release is apcctrl-3.8.1.  However 
apcctrl-3.8.2Beta14 has been used with no problems by this author.


===================
3. Installation
===================

Obtain the source and unpack it in a suitable place such as /usr/src/.
Compiler optimizations can be used with apcctrl.  See Optimization.txt hint
and the apcctrl manual for more information.

===================
3.1 Generic
===================
Run the following command:

./configure --prefix=/usr --sbindir=/sbin

This is a basic installation.  If you have a smartups and wish to have a web
interface to the APC unit's status from your web server see the apcctrl manual.
You will probably want to run the above commands with additions:

./configure --prefix=/usr --sbindir=/sbin \
 --with-cgi-bin=/home/httpd/cgi-bin --enable-cgi

Now run:

make &&
make install

===================
3.2 LFS specific
===================

At the end of the make install you will get the messages listed above in the
introduction.  A bootscript and proper halt script must be manually
installed.

==================
3.2.1 Bootscript
==================

Use the template script in /etc/init.d as a guide to make the boot script.

cd /etc/init.d
cp template apcctrl

Now edit the apcctrl file to make the following bootscript:

#!/bin/sh
# Begin /etc/init.d/apcctrl
#
# S200 in /etc/rc{2,3,4,5}.d and K990 /etc/rc{0,1,6}.d
#
source /etc/init.d/functions

case "$1" in
        start)
		# House keeping if this were a restart from powerfail
		rm -f /etc/apcctrl/powerfail
		rm -f /etc/nologin
		# Start apcctrl
                echo -n "Starting apcctrl power management ..."
                loadproc /sbin/apcctrl
                ;;

        stop)
                echo -n "Stopping apcctrl power management..."
                killproc apcctrl
                ;;

        reload)
                echo -n "Reloading apcctrl power management ..."
                reloadproc apcctrl
                ;;

        restart)
                $0 stop
                sleep 1
                $0 start
                ;;

        status)
                statusproc apcctrl
                ;;

        *)
                echo "Usage: $0 {start|stop|reload|restart|status}"
                exit 1
        ;;

esac

# End /etc/init.d/apcctrl


=====================
3.2.2 Poweroff script
=====================

This poweroff script is needed to shutdown the UPS after the system has halted.
(Note: Depending on the UPS this could take a minute or two).  Thus when the 
power returns the UPS will come back on and the system will power up (providing
your atx bios supports powerup).  

apcctrl for most distributions modifies the existing halt script.  Rather than
that route we are making a separate script called UPSdown.

Using a text editor create UPSdown as follows in /etc/init.d:

#!/bin/sh
# Begin /etc/init.d/UPSdown
#
# Script to shutdown UPS after computer shutdown
#
# Symlink in rc0.d after umounting filesystems
#
#
# See if this is a powerfail situation
if [ -f /etc/apcctrl/powerfail ]; then
        echo
        echo "APCCTRL will now power off the UPS"
        echo
        /etc/apcctrl/apccontrol killpower       
        echo
        echo "Verify the UPS shuts down or turn off the system"
        echo
fi
#
# End /etc/init.d/UPSdown


=========================
3.2.3 Symlink the scripts
=========================
The apcctrl daemon should be started fairly soon in the boot cycle to provide
protection.  Using three digit symlinks, S200 for my system seems appropriate.
Use your own judgement here.

Stopping the daemon should occur fairly late.  I use K990.

The UPSdown script should be run immediately prior to the halt script.  If
halt is S999 then UPSdown would be S998.

Run the following:

cd /etc/init.d &&
chmod 754 apcctrl UPSdown &&
cd ../rc0.d &&
ln -s ../init.d/apcctrl K990apcctrl &&
ln -s ../init.d/UPSdown S998UPSdown &&
cd ../rc1.d &&
ln -s ../init.d/apcctrl K990apcctrl &&
cd ../rc2.d &&
ln -s ../init.d/apcctrl S200apcctrl &&
cd ../rc3.d &&
ln -s ../init.d/apcctrl S200apcctrl &&
cd ../rc4.d &&
ln -s ../init.d/apcctrl S200apcctrl &&
cd ../rc5.d &&
ln -s ../init.d/apcctrl S200apcctrl &&
cd ../rc6.d &&
ln -s ../init.d/apcctrl K990apcctrl

4. Configuration
================

Our generic configure in  3.1 above placed the configuration file in
/etc/apcctrl.  This file is called apcctrl.conf.  Pleae consult the apcctrl
manual to determine the settings for your system and APC model UPS.

================
5. Conclusion
==============
The above steps were an attempt to have you quickly provide APC UPS power
protection to your system using apcctrl software.  The software allows the
individual user a lot of options depending on his needs and desires.  For
example I use the cgi feature to be able to see the status of my UPS from a
browser.  I use the notification feature to mail the electric company that I
have loss power.  These and other features along with a description of the
workings of apcctrl are fully described in the apcctrl manual.
