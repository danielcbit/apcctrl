apcctrl has been installed.

If you are installing for the first time, an editor will be opened with the apcctrl configuration file, apcctrl.conf. Please edit the file as described in the apcctrl manual (http://www.apcctrl.org/manual) and save your changes before rebooting.

If you are upgrading from an existing installation, your apcctrl.conf file will be preserved and a new default file will be provided as apcctrl.conf.new. In most cases you can continue to use your existing configuration file unmodified, but please check the release notes and/or compare against apcctrl.conf.new to catch any required changes.

If you encounter any problems with the installation or operation of apcctrl, please join the apcctrl-users mailing list (http://www.apcctrl.org/email-lists/) and post any questions there.
